| # | Raised by | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | spec-author | Edge vocabulary diverges from the pitch. Breadcrumbs-v2 specifies `duplicate_of / extends / related`; the built schema has `extends / contradicts / related-to`. Proposed: implement all three from the pitch and **retain `contradicts` as a superset** — a prior result that contradicts the current hypothesis is exactly what this product exists to surface, and dropping it would destroy information already in the schema. Needs a human accept. | warn | open |
| 2 | spec-author | The committed `ingestion/breadcrumbs.db` cannot be migrated by editing `graph_schema.sql`: `connect()` runs `executescript` with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so the old CHECK constraints survive. Resolution: `_migrate_graph_vocabulary` disables foreign keys outside the transaction, rebuilds both tables, maps `related-to` to `related`, runs `foreign_key_check`, and is tested twice against a legacy graph plus a `/tmp` copy of the tracked DB with counts preserved. The binary itself stays on main's authoritative version and migrates on first connection after merge. | warn | resolved |
| 3 | spec-author | `schema/seed_findings.json` still carries `{{ }}` placeholders for F-118 (HR, CI, p, n, medians), pending the real TCGA LUAD run. The demo cannot be rehearsed end-to-end until they are filled. | warn | open |
| 4 | spec-author | BC-GRAPH-007's `ingest_dataset_catalog.py scrape` subcommand (live Playwright walk of `/explore-data/patient-data/<DATASET>`) has not been run against the authenticated production page — its DOM-ancestor-walk selector (`find_column_grid_text`) is a best-effort guess, not a verified selector. The `overview`/`table` file-recovery subcommands ARE verified, against a real captured MOSAIC Window page (`tests/test_dataset_catalog.py`). Before relying on `scrape`, run it headed (`--headed`) against a real dataset and fix selectors as needed; also check whether the Explore Data page is backed by its own JSON API (like `/api/chats` is for chat) before investing further in the DOM walk — that would be far more robust. | warn | open |
